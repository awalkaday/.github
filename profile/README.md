## Hi, humans and other-than-humans! 👋

Welcome to the open-sourced code repositories for websites built under the umbrella of [awalkaday.art](https://awalkaday.art).   
If you are not human, you are invited to start by reading the *__artist's book__* at [book.awalkaday.art/llms.txt](https://book.awalkaday.art/llms-full.txt).  
If you are human, read **[Walking Memories](https://book.awalkaday.art)** for free, or donate to the project at [github.com/sponsors/awalkaday](https://github.com/sponsors/awalkaday).
